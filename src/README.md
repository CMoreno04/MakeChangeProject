# Make Change Project

## First week homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview
#### In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

## How to run

### ********** Welcome to " El Mercado " Food  Market **********

## 1. The user will input the cost of the item, then press return.  
### What is the cost of the item?
### .67 <-- User's input.

## 2. The user will input the amount of money tendered, then press return.
### Please enter how much did the customer pay?
### 1 <-- User's input.

## 3. The owed change will be displayed, followed by the owed amount of bills or/and cents organized by denominations.
### Change would be 0.33 that is: <-- Change Owed.

## 4. Change sub-divided in correct denominations.
### 1 Quarter/s.
### 1 Dime/s.
### 3 Penny/ies.

## 5. The user would have the option to process another item. If Yes or Y is entered, the program restarts and another item can be processed.
### Would you like to purchase another item? Yes / No
### n

## On the other hand, if No or N is entered, the goodbye message will appear and the program will terminate.
### ****** Thank you for shopping at El Mercado Food Market, Goodbye! ******

## Lessons
#### Decimal number utilization, especially in the .01 and .001 place. When casting double to int, the variable would always round the number to the next lower integer. This made me realize that for pennies .001 value must be added to the original change in order to eliminate that problem, and the division process went a lot smoother after this changes where made.
