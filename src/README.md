# Make Change Project

## First week homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview
#### In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

## How to run


### 1. The user will input the cost of the item, then press return.  

### 2. The user will input the amount of money tendered, then press return.

### 3. The owed change will be displayed, followed by the owed amount of bills or/and cents organized by denominations.

### 5. The user would have the option to process another item. If "Yes" or "Y" is entered, the program restarts and another item can be processed. On the other hand, if "No" or "N" is entered, the goodbye message will appear and the program will terminate.

## Lessons
#### Decimal number utilization, especially in the .01 and .001 place. When casting double to int, the variable would always round the number to the next lower integer. This made me realize that for pennies .001 value must be added to the original change in order to eliminate that problem, and the division process went a lot smoother after this changes where made.
